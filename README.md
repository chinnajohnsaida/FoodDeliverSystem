The Online Food Delivery Web Application is a full-stack project designed to simulate the functionality of a real-world food delivery platform. This application allows users to explore restaurants, browse menus, place orders, and track them in real-time, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience. The project showcases my ability to integrate frontend, backend, and database technologies into a cohesive, efficient, and practical system.

The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JSP (JavaServer Pages) to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface. The backend is implemented using Java Servlets within Eclipse IDE, which handles core functionalities such as user authentication, order placement, and data management. For the database layer, MySQL is used to store and manage data, including user accounts, restaurant details, menus, and orders, ensuring fast retrieval and data integrity. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is leveraged to enable secure and optimized communication between the backend and database.

Key features of the application include a secure user authentication system, restaurant browsing with search and filter options, seamless order placement, and real-time order tracking. Additionally, the platform includes an admin panel where administrators can manage restaurants, menus, and incoming orders. The project structure is well-organized, with separate modules for controllers, models, utilities, and web pages, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
